# SN 6th Expressions Notes

#What is an algorithm?
    # a collection of numbers and symbols in order to get a result.
#List steps in an algorithm
    # 1.) Variables/pieces of info needed
    # 2.) Process info
#List ALL of the different mathematical operators
    # "+"= addition
    # "-"= subtraction
    # "*"= multiply
    # "/"= division
#List ALL of the assignment operators
    # 
name = input("what is your name? ")
print("Hello", name)

#algorithm for area
length = 5
width = 20
area = length * width 
print(length, "X", width, "=", area)

#algorithm example
age_1 = 13
age_2 = 14
age_3 = 14
age_4 = 15
total = age_1 + age_2 + age_3 + age_4
average = (total/4)
print("The average age between my friends are", + average)

#math equations
num_one = 10
num_two = 6

print("addition:", num_one + num_two)
print("subtraction:", num_one - num_two)
print("multiplication", num_one * num_two)
print("division:", num_one / num_two)
print("exponents:", num_one ** num_two)
print("integer division:", num_one // num_two) 
print("modulo (remainder):", num_one % num_two)
